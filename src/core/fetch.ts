 * A GET whose connection-level failure says what it could not reach.

 * When `fetch` never gets a response at all (offline, DNS, TLS, no route) it rejects
 * with a bare `TypeError: fetch failed`, which reaches the top-level handler as
 * "Error: fetch failed" and names neither the host nor what the CLI wanted from it.
 * A non-ok response is left to the caller, which knows what its status means.
