# seamless-cli

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 993d386: Add `seamless verify`, a one-command cross-package auth conformance harness. It stands up the
  auth API, the Express adapter, and the React starter, then runs a matrix of flows (register,
  email and phone OTP, magic-link, passkey register and login, OAuth, TOTP, step-up, refresh,
  sessions, logout, organizations, admin bootstrap, and JWKS) across the api, adapter, and
  browser layers, and prints a pass/fail grid alongside JUnit and HTML reports.

  Supports `--local` (build the `@seamless-auth/*` packages from source for pre-publish contract
  testing) and a released mode against the published packages, plus filters like `--api-only`,
  `--no-react`, `--filter`, and `--keep-up`. Ships a reusable GitHub workflow so a change in any
  ecosystem repo runs the matrix against the others.
