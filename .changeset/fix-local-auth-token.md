"seamless-cli": patch

Fix local auth mode regenerating the auth server's `.env` a second time with fresh secrets, which left the scaffolded API's `API_SERVICE_TOKEN` mismatched with the auth server's when services run outside Docker. The compose builder now reads the already-written auth env instead of rewriting it.
